# Exercise scripts

Each SQL exercise lives in `scratches/data-analytics/exercises/`. Run it against `analytics_demo` after running `scratches/data-analytics/load_all_data.sh`. Example:

```
mysql -u root analytics_demo < scratches/data-analytics/exercises/exercise01_baseline_metrics.sql
```

Top-level documentation resides in `scratches/data-analytics/course_outline.md`; the exercises expand the micro‑tasks listed there.
